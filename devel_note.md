Plan out the development

0. Image directories 

1. Image reader that's done in the main

2. tracker 

3. image feature track class 


How to evaluate the pipeline 

Benchmark 

Admit it.
You are just a beginner still


Where is the good place for feature extraction

It's the Frame class. This class gets the input of image. 


How do I experiment the different types of features 

Class inheritance 

-> Feature extractor : generalized feature extractor 
-> base class 
-> inherit 


Optical flow approach from prev to current image tracking
no compact match vector 
-> each index in the list directly corresponds to the feature idx. 

match idx 
it's not the match pair that's obtained. 

Each corresponding feature is in the same idx as in the previous tracking frame's feature sets


With descriptor matching approach
current to the previous tracking



Why?
